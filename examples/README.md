# Azure Static website with CDN Endpoint

Configuration in this directory creates Azure storage account and enable the static website and create optional CDN service for the static website. Few of these resources added/excluded as per your requirement.

## Configure the Azure Provider

Add AzureRM provider to start with the module configuration. Whilst the `version` attribute is optional, we recommend, not to pinning to a given version of the Provider.

## Create resource group

By default, this module will not create a resource group and the name of an existing resource group to be given in an argument `create_resource_group`. If you want to create a new resource group, set the argument `create_resource_group = true`.

*If you are using an existing resource group, then this module uses the same resource group location to create all resources in this module.*

## Adding TAG's to your Azure resources

Use tags to organize your Azure resources and management hierarchy. You can apply tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name "Environment" and the value "Production" to all the resources in production. You can manage these values variables directly or mapping as a variable using `variables.tf`.

All network resources which support tagging can be tagged by specifying key-values in argument `tags`. Tag Name is added automatically on all resources. For example, you can specify `tags` like this as per environment:

```
module "static-website-cdn" {
  source                = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-static-website-cdn?ref=v1.0.0"
  create_resource_group = false

  # ... omitted

  tags = {
    Terraform   = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
    Owner       = "test-user"
  }
}
```

## Module Usage

## Static Website

Following example to create a storage account with static website.

```
module "static-website-cdn" {
  source                  = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-static-website-cdn?ref=v1.0.0"

# Resource Group
  create_resource_group   = false
  resource_group_name     = "rg-demo-westeurope-01"
  location                = "westeurope"
  storage_account_name    = "storageaccwesteupore01"

# Static Website options
  enable_static_website   = true
  static_website_source_folder = var.static_website_source_folder

# Tags for Azure Resources  
  tags = {
    Terraform   = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
    Owner       = "test-user"
  }
}
```

## Static Website with CDN endpoint

Following example to create a storage account, static website with CDN endpoint.

```
module "static-website-cdn" {
  source                  = "github.com/tietoevry-infra-as-code/terraform-azurerm-static-website-cdn?ref=v1.0.0"

# Resource Group
  create_resource_group   = false
  resource_group_name     = "rg-demo-westeurope-01"
  location                = "westeurope"
  storage_account_name    = "storageaccwesteupore01"

# Static Website options
  enable_static_website   = true
  static_website_source_folder = var.static_website_source_folder

# CDN endpoint for satic website
  enable_cdn_profile      = true
  cdn_profile_name        = var.cdn_profile_name
  cdn_sku_profile         = var.cdn_sku_profile

# Tags for Azure Resources  
  tags = {
    Terraform   = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
    Owner       = "test-user"
  }
}
```

## Terraform Usage

To run this example you need to execute following Terraform commands

```
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
